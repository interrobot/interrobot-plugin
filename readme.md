Your web crawler just got superpowers. InterroBot plugins transform your web crawler into a customizable data powerhouse, unleashing unlimited potential for data extraction and analysis.

InterroBot plugins are simple HTML/JS/CSS pages that transform raw web crawl data into profound insights, stunning visualizations, and interactive dashboards. With our flexible API, you can create custom plugins that analyze website content across entire domains, connecting with analytics, LLMs, or your favorite SaaS for deeper insights.

Our plugin ecosystem is designed for versatility. Whether you're building proprietary tools, developing plugins for clients, or contributing to the open-source community, InterroBot plugins adapt to your needs. Available for Windows 10/11, macOS, and Android, our platform ensures your data analysis can happen wherever you work.

## How Does it Work?

If you're familiar with vanilla TypeScript or JavaScript, creating a custom plugin script for InterroBot is remarkably straight forward. First you start with a [bare-bones HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interrobot/interrobot-plugin/refs/heads/master/examples/vanillajs/basic.html) and a script extending the Plugin base class.

```javascript
// TypeScript vs. JavaScript, both are fine. See examples.
import { Plugin } from "./src/ts/core/plugin";
class BasicExamplePlugin extends Plugin {    
    static meta = {
        "title": "Example Plugin",
        "category": "Example",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "author": "InterroBot",
        "synopsis": `a basic plugin example`,
        "description": `This example is as simple as it gets.`,
    };
    constructor() {
        super();
        // initialize InterroBot plugin from iframe - i.e. your plugin page
        this.init(BasicExamplePlugin.meta);        
        // index() has nothing to do with the crawl index, btw. it is 
        // the plugin index (think index.html), a view that shows by
        // default, and would generally consist of a form or visualization.
        this.index();
    }
}
Plugin.initialize(BasicExamplePlugin);
```

BasicExamplePlugin will not do much at this point, but it will load and run the default `index()` behavior.
You can, of course, override the default `index()` behavior, rendering your page however you wish.

```javascript
async index() {
    // add your form and supporting HTML
    this.render(`<div>HTML</div>`);
    // initialize the plugin within InterroBot, from within iframe
    await this.initData(BasicExamplePlugin.meta, {}, []);    
    // add handlers to the form
    const button = document.querySelector("button");
    button.addEventListener("click", async (ev) => { 
        await this.process(); // where process() is a form handler
    });
}
```

The `process()` method called above would be where you process data. Here a query is executed on 
the crawl index, and each result run through the exampleResultsHandler.


```
protected async process() {
    // gather title words and running counts with a result handler
    const titleWords: Map<string, number> = new Map<string, number>();
    let resultsMap: Map<number, SearchResult>;
    const exampleResultHandler = async (result: SearchResult, 
        titleWordsMap: Map<string, number>) => {
        const terms: string[] = result.name.trim().split(/[\s\-—]+/g);
        terms.forEach(term => titleWordsMap.set(term, 
            (titleWordsMap.get(term) ?? 0) + 1));
    }
    // projectId comes for free as a member of Plugin
    const projectId: number = this.getProjectId();
    const freeQueryString: string = "headers: text/html";
    // pipe delimited fields you want retrieved. id and url come with 
    // the base model, everything else must be requested explicitly
    const fields: string = "name";
    const internalHtmlPagesQuery = new SearchQuery(projectId, 
        freeQueryString, fields, SearchQueryType.Any, false);
    // run each SearchResult through its handler, and we're done processing
    await Search.execute(internalHtmlPagesQuery, resultsMap, "Processing…", 
        async (result: SearchResult) => {
            await exampleResultHandler(result, titleWords);
        }
    );
    // call for html presentation of titleWords with processing complete
    await this.report(titleWords);
}
```
