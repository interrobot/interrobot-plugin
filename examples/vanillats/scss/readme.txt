You can set up your own tooling, or manually compile Sass

From current working directory:
~> [your libsass wrapper] ./interrobot-plugin.scss ../css/interrobot-plugin.css

Don't have a Sass, but have Python?
~> pip install libsass
~> pysassc ./interrobot-plugin.scss ../css/interrobot-plugin.css

Don't feel like sass in the first place?
Modify the example css directly, it's fine.
